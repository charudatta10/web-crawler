For instance, a recent study reported that 2,359 tigers were seized between 2000 and 2018 across 32 countries. Another found that around 895,000 pangolins were trafficked globally between 2000 and 2019. Wildlife forensics is, therefore, an important means of 
combating the illegal trade of wildlife

Be a savvy tourist. While abroad, be conscious of places that may be advertising experiences with animals that could be linked to 
wildlife 
trafficking or partaking in photographs which could inadvertently promote the trafficking of 
wildlife
.
 
Buy sustainably sourced products. Be a responsible consumer 
and 
stick to products with transparent 
and 
ethical supply chains. Whenever buying any products made from wood ensure the wood has been harvested ethically 
and 
sustainably, for example by checking they are FSC certified.
 
Say NO to endangered 
and 
exotic animal products. Be aware 
and 
avoid buying products derived from 
wildlife
, plants, or other items made from them, online or in stores, even if legal within the country of origin.
 
Avoid the unusual. When abroad it is tempting to order the bizarre or the extraordinary for the sake of an anecdote or out of simple curiosity. Think carefully before you do.
